# The "helpful" repository
The "helpful" repository is the repository of my functions and tricks that could be fit in almost any project.
There are 2 files by now:
# "preprocessing.py"
Some useful functions to process the data sets before training the model.
# "model_visuals"
Really useful functions for a quick evaluation of the model's performance.
